# Updates this deployment to the latest commit on GitHub. Made for a cPanel account over SSH:
#
#   cd ~/kf-inventory && ./deploy/cpanel-update.sh
#
# It pulls, installs the PHP dependencies, rebuilds (or checks) the UI, runs the database migrations,
# clears the production cache and fixes what has to be writable. Every step is safe to run again.
#
# Moving an existing account to this layout (the restructure: the app now lives in backend/), once:
#   1. Back up the database (cPanel › Backup, or mysqldump). The restructure adds one table (messenger_messages) and
#      changes nothing else in it.
#   2. Move the old settings: the old checkout kept them in .env at its root; put them in backend/.env.local
#      (deploy/env.local.example lists them), with APP_ENV=prod, then chmod 600 it and delete the old root .env.
#   3. Point the domain's document root at ~/kf-inventory/backend/public (it was ~/kf-inventory/public).
#   4. cPanel › MultiPHP Manager: PHP 8.4 for the domain; MultiPHP INI Editor: date.timezone America/Bogota (as the
#      old public/.htaccess had), upload_max_filesize and post_max_size as before.
#   5. Run this script, then add the cron line it prints (the order emails are queued now).
#   6. Everyone signs in again once (the sessions of the old version do not carry over). The WooCommerce webhook URL
#      does not change.
#
# First time on a new account: git clone <repo> ~/kf-inventory, then steps 2 to 5.
#
# Settings it takes from the environment, all optional:
#   PHP         path to the PHP 8.4 CLI  (detected)
#   COMPOSER    path to composer         (detected)
#   BRANCH      branch to pull           (the checked out one)
#   SKIP_PULL   =1 to rebuild without pulling
#   ALLOW_DIRTY =1 to run with local changes to tracked files (the pull fails if it touches one)
#   BACKUP_ALWAYS =1 to dump the database even when no migration is pending
#   BACKUP_DIR  where the dump goes (default: the home directory)
